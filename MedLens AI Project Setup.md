### User Input

Vision Possible: Agent Protocol is an online hackathon by WeMakeDevs (part of their Hack All February series), running Feb 23 – Mar 1. The core challenge is to build a multi-modal AI agent that can watch, listen, and understand video in real-time using the Vision Agents SDK by Stream.
Prize pool: $4,000+ plus swag and potential job interviews.

🛠️ What You Need to Build
You must build a real-time Vision AI project — something that processes live video intelligently. Some inspiration from the site:

🏌️ Golf Coach — Real-time pose tracking with YOLO + Gemini for feedback
📷 Security Camera — Face recognition, package detection, theft response
🌍 GeoGuesser — OpenAI Realtime identifying real-world locations from video
📞 Phone + RAG — Twilio integration with retrieval-augmented generation
🎨 Realtime Stable Diffusion — Interactive scene generation from live video

You can also come up with anything creative in the real-time Vision AI space — security systems, sports coaching, drone detection, interactive gaming, etc.

⚙️ The Required Tech
You MUST use the Vision Agents SDK — this is non-negotiable. The more features you use from it, the better your score. Here's what it offers:

Video AI — Combine vision models like YOLO, Roboflow, and Moondream with LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI, or Claude
Ultra-low latency — Join in 500ms, audio/video latency under 30ms via Stream's edge network
Native LLM APIs — Direct access to OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude without wrapper limitations
Multi-platform SDKs — Build in React, Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, or Unity
Processors — Manage state and handle audio/video in real-time with pluggable processors
Tool Calling — Execute APIs and functions mid-conversation


📋 Rules to Follow

Team size: 1–4 people. Teams can vary across hackathons in this series.
You can use starter templates, boilerplates, open-source libraries, and public APIs — but you cannot just submit an existing project with minimal changes.
Planning is allowed before the start, but actual coding/design must begin only after the hackathon kicks off. Notes and diagrams beforehand are fine.
Your project must be software-based. Hardware is optional.
All IP created belongs to your team.
Be respectful — harassment or discrimination leads to immediate disqualification.


🏆 How You'll Be Judged
Your project is evaluated on six criteria:

Potential Impact — Does it solve a real, meaningful problem?
Creativity & Innovation — Is the idea unique and boundary-pushing?
Technical Excellence — Is it well-built with strong use of the SDK?
Real-Time Performance — Is it actually low-latency and responsive?
User Experience — Is it polished and intuitive?
Best Use of Vision Agents — How deeply does it leverage the SDK's capabilities?

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the SDK. Let me create a detailed idea document.

### User Input

ok write down a file where you mention all the resources link if stuck and all the tasks that has to be done in order to complete this project and start to execute and complete the project full which is capable of winning the competition.. when stuck anywhere use the links to navigate and get the answers.. 
connect the repo to a github repo and keep track of the version.. keep pushing after a major feature build soo that it helps in version control


### Planner Response

Let me first check the workspace and then create everything needed.

*Listed directory [new](file:///Users/preet/Developer/new) *

*User accepted the command `git remote -v`*

*User accepted the command `git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "No commits yet"`*

*User accepted the command `python3 --version && uv --version 2>/dev/null || echo "uv not found"`*

*User accepted the command `node --version && npm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Node not found"`*

*Checked command status*

### Planner Response

I see this repo currently has a different project (PESU slides downloader). I need to create a fresh repo for MedLens AI. Let me first check the remote, then create the comprehensive resources/task doc and implementation plan.

*Checked command status*

*User accepted the command `gh auth status 2>&1 || echo "gh CLI not installed"`*

### Planner Response

Good — `gh` CLI is authenticated with the `preeeetham` account. The current repo has an existing project. I need to create a new project directory for MedLens AI. Let me first install `uv` (needed for the Vision Agents SDK), then create the comprehensive task/resources doc and implementation plan.

### Planner Response

Now let me create the comprehensive task.md, resources reference, and implementation plan:

Now let me create the implementation plan and look at the existing examples more carefully to base our code off them:

### Planner Response

Let me now look at a real Vision Agents example to ground the implementation plan in actual working code:

### User Input

*User accepted the command `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`*

### Planner Response

Good, `uv` is installed. Now let me set up the project directory, initialize with `uv`, and create the GitHub repo:

*User accepted the command `source $HOME/.local/bin/env && mkdir -p /Users/preet/Developer/medlens-ai && cd /Users/preet/Developer/medlens-ai && uv init --python 3.12 .`*

*User accepted the command `source $HOME/.local/bin/env && cd /Users/preet/Developer/medlens-ai && uv add "vision-agents[getstream,gemini,openai,deepgram,elevenlabs,ultralytics]" python-dotenv 2>&1`*
